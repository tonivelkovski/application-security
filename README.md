# Web Application Security

### Project goals

* Study application security concepts and techniques
* Evaluate the security of web applications using penetration testing
* Demonstrate common application security vulnerabilities and remediation techniques in a virtual environment

### Methodology

* Research and study application security concepts such as input validation, authentication, and access control
* Set up a virtual environment using virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware
* Create a vulnerable web application in the virtual environment using a web development framework such as PHP or Ruby on Rails 
* Use freely available tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to perform penetration testing on the web application 
* Identify and document common application security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery 
* Implement remediation techniques to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, such as input validation and encoding, secure authentication and session management, and access control 
* Evaluate the effectiveness of the remediation techniques and demonstrate the improvement in the security of the web application

### Expected Outcome

* A comprehensive understanding of application security concepts and techniques
* A hands-on demonstration of application security vulnerability assessment and remediation
* An evaluation of the effectiveness of common remediation techniques in improving the security of web applications
* Recommendations for improving the security of web applications in real-world scenarios
